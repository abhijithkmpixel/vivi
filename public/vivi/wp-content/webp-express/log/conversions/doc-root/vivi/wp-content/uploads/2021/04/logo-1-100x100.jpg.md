Converting to lossy
Looking for cwebp binaries.
Discovering if a plain cwebp call works (to skip this step, disable the "try-cwebp" option)
- Executing: cwebp -version 2>&1. Result: *Exec failed* (the cwebp binary was not found at path: cwebp, or it had missing library dependencies)
Nope a plain cwebp call does not work
Discovering binaries using "which -a cwebp" command. (to skip this step, disable the "try-discovering-cwebp" option)
Found 0 binaries
Discovering binaries by peeking in common system paths (to skip this step, disable the "try-common-system-paths" option)
Found 1 binaries: 
- /usr/local/bin/cwebp
Discovering binaries which are distributed with the webp-convert library (to skip this step, disable the "try-supplied-binary-for-os" option)
Checking if we have a supplied precompiled binary for your OS (Darwin)... We do.

Detecting versions of the cwebp binaries found

Binaries ordered by version number.
- /usr/local/bin/cwebp: (version: 1.2.0)
Trying the first of these. If that should fail (it should not), the next will be tried and so on.
Creating command line options for version: 1.2.0
Quality: 70. 
Consider setting quality to "auto" instead. It is generally a better idea
The near-lossless option ignored for lossy
